### Description

Another Method of putting a picture in a command button with style set to normal (to preserve XP skin-ability). This is in response to a posting by Abílio Rodrigues "A Command Button with Icon (XP)" at http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/showcode.asp?txtCodeId=57116&lngWId=1. I tried to post it as a comment on his posting, but received an email saying it did not work. So, it's easier to just upload it as a zip. This works for XP, but might work in other OS's.
